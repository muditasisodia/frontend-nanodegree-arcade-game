# Classic Arcade Game Project
This project is a part of Udacity's Front End Nanodegree.

### How it works
This is a simple arcade game inspired by Frogger.

From the Project Overview:

> The player can move left, right, up and down.
> The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board.
> Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square.
> Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won.


### Code Description
This project required an implementation of Object Oriented Programming.
Enemy and Player functions are defined.
Enemy takes in three parameters, x displacement, y displacement and speed (since the enemy object are constantly in motion).
Player takes in two parameters, x displacement and y displacement.
Three objects of Enemy and one of Player are instantiated.
If the Player reaches a water tile or collides with an Enemy, its position in reset to the beginning.
